# Customer Churn Prediction

This project predicts whether a customer will churn (leave a service) using machine learning.

## 🚀 Steps
1. Data preprocessing
2. Feature engineering
3. Model training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
4. Evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, F1, ROC-AUC)

## 📊 Results
- Best model: Logistic Regression
- Accuracy: 79%
<!-- - F1-score: 0.83 -->

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn?resource=download).  
(Due to size, only a sample CSV is included.)

## ⚙️ Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Customer-Churn-Prediction.git
cd Customer-Churn-Prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
